            story= _ "Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the baron of the city. Every summer, by the time the mountainous paths and high passes shed their wintry gowns of snow, orcs descended from their northern hills to ravage the settlements at the frontier. Every year, Malin’s father led the townsfolk to repel the raids and force the orcs to retreat back to the north."

        [part]
            story= _ "When Malin was 10, a mage who passed through the town sensed strong magical abilities in the boy. His parents, seeing a chance for him to escape the constant war with the orcs, arranged for him to be sent to the mages at the Isle of Alduin. He studied there for eight years, learning all manner of magic, from basic control over the elements, to the mystic arts and scrying, to alchemy and simple medicine."

            story= _ "Malin quickly found that he had considerable talent, especially for arcane sorcery and manipulating the essence of life. In time, however, he grew bored of his studies and began to research magics that were far beyond the teachings of his masters. Despite Malin’s substantial skill, his lack of experience led to a series of failed experiments, one of which cost the life of a fellow student. For his transgressions, he was expelled."

            story= _ "By the time Malin returned to Parthyn, orcs had already begun to attack the city. Although he tried his best to fight them off, the raids were far more relentless and the town guard was far weaker than he had remembered. One night, a particularly powerful strike stormed the city and Malin could only watch as his father was cut down by one of the savage orcish warriors."

            story= _ "Shaken by the loss of their commander, the human defense began to falter. The orcs roared in anticipation of victory, but before they could overrun the city, skeleton warriors poured out of the woods to their rear. The undead cut down orc after orc, swords and axes hacking through flesh and bone with ruthless efficiency. The soldiers watched on in half amazement, half fear as the orcs dropped and the skeletons turned toward them, empty eyes bleeding with fetid magic. All was dreadfully still as the blood and carnage settled in the rank darkness."

While I know you do not love my kind, I think it is vital that we put aside our differences for the moment. The orc menace grows in the north, and they will soon return in even greater force. You cannot hope to defend against them without my help.”</i>"
